# IBM PC File Recovery Project

My ongoing attempt to transfer files from a 1981 IBM PC 5150 to a modern laptop via a serial connection.

My mom used an original IBM PC 5150 throughout the 1980s to write several unpublished books. After sitting in the garage for years, I recently pulled it out, plugged it in and it still booted!

This repo documents my attempt at copying files from the IBM PC to my laptop. It includes extensive documentation and some useful GW-BASIC programs.
